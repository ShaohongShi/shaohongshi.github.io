<h2>Word Meaning</h2>
A word is a combination of form(spelling and pronunciation) and its meaning(what the form stands for).
  <ul>
    <li>Reference is the relationship between language and the world.</li>
    <li>Concept, which is beyond language, is the result of human cognition, reflecting the objective world in the human mind.</li>
    <li>Sense and reference are not on an equal footing in Fregeâ€™s theory of meaning. For him, sense determines reference.</li>
    <li>Every word that has meaning has sense but not every word has reference.</li>
  </ul>
<h2>Motivation</h2>
  How words acquire their meanings. The majority of English words are non-motivated, since they are arbitrary symbols.
  <ul>
    <li>Onomatopoeic: whose sounds suggest their meanings, for these words were created by imitating the natural sounds or noises.</li>
    <li>Morphological: compounds and derived words are multi-morphemic words and the meanings of many are the sum total of the morphemes
      combined. </li>
    <li>Semantic: the mental association suggested by the conceptual meaning of a word. It explores the connection between the literal sense and figurative sense of the word.</li>
    <li>Etymological: The meanings of many words often relate directly to their origins. In other words, the history of the word explains the meaning of the word.</li>
  </ul>
<h2>Grammatical and lexical meaning</h2>
<ul>
<li>Grammatical meanings: grammatical concept or relationships such as part of speech.</li>
<li>Lexical meaning of the content words refer to the thing, quality, state, or action the words represents when used alone. Lexical meaning is constant in all the content words.</li>
<li>Lexical meaning itself has two components: conceptual meaning and associative meaning.</li>
<li>Conceptual meaning is the meaning given in the dictionary and forms the core of wordmeaning. Being constant and relatively stable, conceptual meaning forms the basis for communication as the same word has the same conceptual meaning to all the speakers of the same language.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Associative Meaning</h2>
Associative meaning is the secondary meaning supplemented to the conceptual meaning. It differs from the conceptual meaning in that it is open-ended and indeterminate. It is reliable to the influence of such factors as culture, experience, religion, geographical region, class background, education, etc.
<li>Connotative: the overtones or associations suggested by the conceptual meaning.</li>
<li>Stylistic: which make them appropriate for different contexts. These distinctive features form the stylistic meanings of words. In some dictionaries, these stylistic features are clearly marked as formal, informal, literary, archaic, slang and so on.</li>
<li>Affective: attitude towards the person or thing in question, including appreciative and pejorative values.</li>
<li>Collocative: the associations a word acquires in its collocation.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Componential Analysis</h2>
Componential analysis is the analyzing process of word meaning by breaking down the sense of a word into its minimal components or semantic components.
<ul>
<li> helps to characterize meaning relations (such as synonymy, antonymy and hyponymy) and to have an exact knowledge of the conceptual meaning of words.</li>
<li>explain sense relation between sentences.</li>
</ul>
