	<li>Germanic Celtic Italic Hellenic Albania Amenian Balto-Slavic Indo-Iranian</li>
</ol>

<h2>Word and Lexicology</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Lexicology is the part of linguistics which studies words. This may include their nature and function as symbols, their meaning, the relationship of their meaning to epistemology in general, the rules of their composition from smaller elements, relations between words, which may involve semantics derivation (for example, fathom vs. unfathomably)</li>
	<li>A word is a minimal free form of a language that has a given sound and meaning and syntactic function.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Sound</h2>
Sound and Meaning: Symbolic connection is almost always arbitrary and conventional, except onomatopoeia
<br>Sound and Form: The written form of English is not an accurate representation of the spoken form.
<ul>
	<li>The English alphabet was adopted from the Romans, which does not employ the system of one single letter to stand for one sound.</li>
	<li>The early scribes deliberately changed spelling of words.</li>
	<li>In the late 1500s, printing became well established. It helped to stablize and standardize the spelling of words. Dictionaries help to fix the spelling of words.</li>
	<li>English has borrowed many words from other languages.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Vocabulary</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Meaning
		<ul>
			<li>The total number of the words in a language.</li>
			<li>All the words used in a particular historical period.</li>
			<li>All the words of a given dialect, a given book, a given discipline and the words possessed by an individual person. </li>
		</ul>
	<li>Counting Words: Single word or two words; Phrases; Meaning; Borrowed words</li>
	<li>New Oxford English Dictionary: In 1884, the first edition of The Oxford English Dictionary begins publication. In 1928, the last volume of OED first edition was published. In the 12 volumes, there are a total of 252,259 entries. In 1989, the second edition of OED was published, with a total of 290,500 entries.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Classification</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Basic: All-national character, Great stability, Productivity, Collocability, Plurality of meanings, Stylistically neutral, monosyllabic, High frequency value.</li>
	<li>Non-basic: Terminology, jargon, slang, argot, dialect, archaisms, neologisms</li>
	<li>Native words are not native in fact but words brought to Britain in the fifth century by the German tribes: the Anglos(盎格鲁人), the Saxons(撒克逊人), and the Jutes(朱特人), thus known as Anglo-Saxon words. Native words Neutral in style and frequent in use</li>
	<li>Loan words:
		<ul>
			<li>Denizens Denizens are words borrowed early in the past and now are well assimilated into the English language.</li>
			<li>Aliens are borrowed words which have retained their original pronunciation and spelling.</li>
			<li>Translation-loans are words and expressions formed from the existing material in the English language but modeled on the patterns taken from another language.</li>
			<li>Semantic loans Words of this category are not borrowed with reference to the form but to the meaning. In other words, English has borrowed a new meaning for an existing word in the language.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Content and function words</li>
	<li>Morphology: simple words, compounds and derivatives</li>
	<li>Level of usage: common words, literary words, colloquial words, slang words and technical words</li>
</ul>
