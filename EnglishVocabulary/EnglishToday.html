This may include their <br>-nature and function as symbols,<br>-their meaning, <br>-the relationship of their meaning to epistemology in general, <br>-the rules of their composition from smaller elements <br>-relations between words, which may involve semantics<br>-derivation (for example, fathom vs. unfathomably)</li><li>Definition<br>A word is a minimal free form of a language that has a given sound and meaning and syntactic function.</li><li>Sound and meaning<br>Symbolic connection is almost always arbitrary and conventional, except onomatopoeia</li><li>Sound and Form<br>The written form of English is not an accurate representation of the spoken form.<br>1)The English alphabet was adopted from the Romans, which does not employ the system of one single letter to stand for one sound.<br>2)The early scribes deliberately changed spelling of words<br>3) In the late 1500s, printing became well established. It helped to stablize and standardize the spelling of words. Dictionaries help to fix the spelling of words.<br>4) English has borrowed many words from other languages.</li></ul></li><li>Vocabulary<ul><li>Meaning<br>1) the total number of the words in a language<br>2)all the words used in a particular historical period<br>3)all the words of a given dialect, a given book, a given discipline and the words possessed by an individual person. </li><li>Counting Words<br>Single word or two words?<br>Phrases<br>Meaning<br>Borrowed words</li><li>New Oxford English Dictionary<br>In 1884, the first edition of The Oxford English Dictionary begins publication. <br>In 1928, the last volume of OED first edition was published.

Denizens Denizens are words borrowed early in the past and now are well assimilated into the English language.<br>2. Aliens are borrowed words which have retained their original pronunciation and spelling. <br>3. Translation-loans are words and expressions formed from the existing material in the English language but modeled on the patterns taken from another language. <br>4. Semantic loans Words of this category are not borrowed with reference to the form but to the meaning. In other words, English has borrowed a new meaning for an existing word in the language.</li><li>Content and function words</li><li>Morphology: simple words, compounds and derivatives</li><li>level of usage<br>common words, literary words, colloquial words, slang words and technical words</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Development of the English Vocabulary<ul><li>Old English (450-1150)<ul><li>Celts—Celtic<br>another branch of the Indo- European language family, including Irish, Scottish Gaelic(盖尔语), Welsh, Breton, Manx, Cornish, and several extinct pre-Roman languages such as Gaulish(高卢语).</li><li>The Romans (Pre-English period)<br>In 55---54 B.C., the Romans, headed by Julius Caesar the Great, invaded the British Isles and were to occupy the land until about 410.</li><li>The Anglo-Saxon Invasion(449-1066)<br>We get our syntax, the grammatical arrangement ofwords in a sentence, from the Anglo-Saxons.<br>The Anglo-Saxon gods lend their names to days of the week.<br>It is from this language that our present-day English is derived.</li><li>The Vikings(787 AD-the begining of 11th century) <br>In the north of England, dialects of English become strongly influenced by Scandinavian languages.</li><li>Vocabulary(about 50,000 to 60,000 words)<br>It was a highly inflected language just like modern German.

This does not increase the number of word forms but create many more new usages of the words, thus enriching the vocabulary.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li>
