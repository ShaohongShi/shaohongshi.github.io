Sense relation are the relations held between the words within the vocabulary.
<h2>Polysemy</h2>
Polysemy means that one single word has two or more senses at the same time. Monosemic words are rare, and are mainly scientific terms. Most words are polysemous.
Approaches
<ul>
    <li>Diachronic approach: the result of growth and development of the semantic structure of the word, from primary meaning to derived meanings.</li>
    <li>Synchronic approach: the coexistence of various meanings of the same word in a historical period from central meaning to secondary meaning.</li>
</ul>
Patterns of development
<ul>
    <li>Radiation: A semantic process in which the primary meaning stands at the centre and the secondary meanings proceed out of it in every direction like rays.</li>
    <li>Concatenation: A semantic process in which the meaning of a word moves gradually away from its first sense by successive shifts until, in many cases, there is not a sign of connection between the sense that is finally developed and that is at the beginning.</li>
</ul>
