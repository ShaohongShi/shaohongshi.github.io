Sense relation are the relations held between the words within the vocabulary.
<h2>Polysemy</h2>
Polysemy means that one single word has two or more senses at the same time. Monosemic words are rare, and are mainly scientific terms. Most words are polysemous.
<br>Approaches
<ul>
    <li>Diachronic approach: the result of growth and development of the semantic structure of the word, from primary meaning to derived meanings.</li>
    <li>Synchronic approach: the coexistence of various meanings of the same word in a historical period from central meaning to secondary meaning.</li>
</ul>
Patterns of development
<ul>
    <li>Radiation: A semantic process in which the primary meaning stands at the centre and the secondary meanings proceed out of it in every direction like rays.</li>
    <li>Concatenation: A semantic process in which the meaning of a word moves gradually away from its first sense by successive shifts until, in many cases, there is not a sign of connection between the sense that is finally developed and that is at the beginning.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Homonymy</h2>
Homonyms are words different in meaning but identical in sound or spelling. Differentiation of Homonyms from Polysemants is etymology.
<ul>
    <li>Perfect homonyms: absolute homonyms.</li>
    <li>Homograph and homophones, the latter of which constitute the largest number and are most common.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
Kinds
<ul>
	<li>Absolute synonyms: identical in meaning in all its aspects, i.e.both in grammatical meaning and lexical meaning, including conceptual meaning and associative meanings.</li>
	<li>Relative synonyms: similar to or nearly the same in denotation, but embrace different shades of meaning or different degree of a given quality, such as affection, rhetoric, literary style, etc.</li>
</ul>
Sources: Borrowing, dialects and regional English, figurative and euphemistic use of words, coincidence with idiomatic expressions.
<br>Discriminatin
<ul>
	<li>Denotation: differ in the range and intensity of meaning.</li>
	<li>Connotation: the stylistic and emotive coloring of words.</li>
</ul>
Appication: Structure and collocation.
<h2>Antonyms</h2>
Types
<ul>
	<li>Complementaries: mutually exclusive and non-gradable.</li>
	<li>Contraries: a scale running between two poles or extremes.</li>
	<li>Converses:  a reciprocal social relationship that one of them cannot be used without suggesting the other.</li>
</ul>
Characteristics
<ul>
	<li>More synonyms than antonyms.</li>
	<li>A word which has more than one meaning can have more than one antonym.</li>
	<li>Semantic inclusion: marked and unmarked terms, one member is more specific than the other and the meaning of the specific is included in that of the general.</li>
	<li>Contrary terms are gradable antonyms, differing in degree of intensity, so each has its own corresponding opposite.</li>
</ul>
Use: define the meanings of words, express economically the opposite of a particular thought, oxymoron
<h2>Hyponymy</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Hyponymy: deals with the relationship of semantic inclusion</li>
	<li>Taxonomy: the science of classifications</li>
	<li>Meronymy: part-whole relationship between lexical items.</li>
	<li>Pseudo-hypomymy</li>
</ul>
<h2>Semantic field</h2>
A semantic field contains words that belong to a defined area of meaning.
<br>A lexical gap refers to a possible word form that just doesnâ€™t exist in the language.
